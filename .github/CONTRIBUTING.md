We use GitHub to host code and documentation, to track issues and feature requests as well as to receive pull requests.

## How to contribute

Found a bug?
Missing a feature?

If you find a typo, a bug or some other kind of error in the source code or documentation, you can help us by [opening an issue](https://github.com/jramos-br/jsdoc-summarize2/issues/new/choose).
Even better, if you can fix the problem with a small change, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/jramos-br/jsdoc-summarize2/pulls).

If you'd like to suggest a new feature or a major change, start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/jramos-br/jsdoc-summarize2/issues/new/choose) with a description of what you'd like to do and why.
This way, your suggestions can be discussed with other people before any changes are made.

Important: before you open an issue or submit a pull request, be sure to [search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests) through the [issues](https://github.com/jramos-br/jsdoc-summarize2/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/jramos-br/jsdoc-summarize2/pulls) in the repository, to see whether someone else has raised a similar question.
