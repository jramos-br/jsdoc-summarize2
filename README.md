##

[Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2) is a plugin for [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc), which is a tool to generate HTML documentation from comment blocks added directly in JavaScript source code.
A [JSDoc comment block](http://usejsdoc.org) looks like this:

```js
/**
 * @summary A short description of a program element.
 *
 * @description A long and more or less detailed description of a program
 * element, usually spanning multiple lines and eventually with HTML and
 * markdown formatted text.
 *
 * @type {string}
 */
```

The [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2) plugin rewrites some tags of the comment block according to a set of simple rules.
In short, when there is more than one description tag, the plugin transforms the first one into a summary tag, if it doesn't already exist.

## Example

Here is a [JSDoc comment block](http://usejsdoc.org) of a simple function.

```js
/**
 * Adds two Fibonacci primes.
 *
 * @param {number} x The first addend.
 * @param {number} y The second addend.
 *
 * @returns {number} The sum of x and y.
 *
 * @description Sums two numbers only if both are Fibonacci primes.
 * Otherwise the function returns -1 to indicate an error.
 *
 * @description A Fibonacci prime is a Fibonacci number that is prime.
 *
 * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_prime
 */
```

When [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) runs, [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2) changes the original comment block as follows:

- A summary tag is created from the first (untagged) description.
- The two other descriptions are combined into a single one.

```js
/**
 * @summary A function to add two Fibonacci primes.
 *
 * @param {number} first The first number to add.
 * @param {number} second The second number to add.
 *
 * @returns {number} The sum of `first` and `second` numbers.
 *
 * @description Sums two numbers only if both are Fibonacci primes.
 * Otherwise the function returns -1 to indicate an error.<br/>
 * A Fibonacci prime is a Fibonacci number that is prime.
 *
 * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_prime
 */
```

The full example is in the [example](example) directory.
You can also see the HTML [page](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jramos-br/jsdoc-summarize2/blob/master/example/out/module-example.html) generated by [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) as well as the markdown [document](example/api.md) generated by [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://npm.im/jsdoc-to-markdown).

## Motivation

The [Visual Studio Code Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript#_intellisense) uses [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) tags to determine object types.
The absence of the summary tag lets the Intellisense output a little bit cleaner.
Also, sometimes it's good to create multiple paragraphs of description without markdown or HTML embedded tags.
In essence, it's just a matter of taste.

Consider the following [JSDoc comment block](http://usejsdoc.org) with two description tags.
The first one is untagged and the second is tagged.

```js
/**
 * A short description of a program element.
 *
 * @description A long and more or less detailed description of a program
 * element, usually spanning multiple lines and eventually with HTML and
 * markdown formatted text.
 *
 * @type {string}
 */
```

The default behavior of [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) is to use only the last description in the comment block.
Previous descriptions, if any, are ignored.
Using the [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2) plugin, you can write a comment block like the one above and, during the [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) run, the plugin automatically transforms the first description into a summary.

## Quick start

1. Install the npm packages.
2. Create the [JSDoc configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html).
3. Generate the HTML documentation.

The following code samples use `path/to/file.js` to represent the source code file names.

### Unix

```
npm install --save-dev jsdoc
npm install --save-dev jsdoc-summarize2

cp ./node_modules/jsdoc-summarize2/example/jsdoc-conf.json .

./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc -c jsdoc-conf.json path/to/file.js
```

### Windows

```
npm install --save-dev jsdoc
npm install --save-dev jsdoc-summarize2

copy .\node_modules\jsdoc-summarize2\example\jsdoc-conf.json .

.\node_modules\.bin\jsdoc -c jsdoc-conf.json path/to/file.js
```

## Usage

Run [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) with the `--configure ` or `-c` [command line](http://usejsdoc.org/about-commandline.html) option to use the [configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html) prepared during the installation.
The installation instructions suggest the name `jsdoc-conf.json` for it.
The paths of the individual source code files must also be passed as [command line](http://usejsdoc.org/about-commandline.html) arguments.

The following instructions use `index.js`, `module1.js` and `module2.js` as examples of source code file names.
Additionally, they use the [npx](https://npm.im/npx) command to run [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc).
The command `npx jsdoc` is equivalent to `./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc` (with backslash on Windows).
[npx](https://npm.im/npx) is available as of [npm@5.2.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5.2.0).

```
npx jsdoc -c jsdoc-conf.json index.js module1.js module2.js
```

If you prefer, use the `scripts` property in the `package.json` to define a command to execute [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) via [npm run](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script).

```json
"scripts": {
    "jsdoc": "jsdoc -c jsdoc-conf.json index.js module1.js module2.js"
},
```

Now you can run [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) via [npm run](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) with the previously defined arguments.

```
npm run jsdoc
```

### Transformation rules

These are the rules used by [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2) to process the comment blocks.
The [example](example) directory contains the source code to demonstrate all cases.

- If the comment block already has a summary tag, nothing will change.

- A single description tag will not change.

- If there are two description tags in the comment block, the first one is transformed into a summary.

    ```
                      +---------------+
    @description +--> |    summary    |
                      +---------------+

                      +---------------+
    @description +--> |  description  |
                      +---------------+
    ```

- If there are more than two description tags in the comment block, the first one is transformed into a summary and the remaining are combined into a single description.

    ```
                      +---------------+
    @description +--> |    summary    |
                      +---------------+

                      +---------------+
    @description +--> | description 1 |
          +---------> | description 2 |
          |           +---------------+
          +
    @description
    ```

## How to install

The following instructions [install](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally) the packages locally.
If you prefer a global rather than a local install, please use `-g` instead of `--save-dev`.

1. First you need to install [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc), if it's not already installed.

    ```
    npm install --save-dev jsdoc
    ```

2. Then you should install [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2). The package name is jsdoc-summarize2.

    ```
    npm install --save-dev jsdoc-summarize2
    ```

3. Next you need to tell [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) to enable the [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2) plugin.
You do this by creating a [JSDoc configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html) with the appropriate parameters.
When you later run [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc), you must tell it to use the prepared [configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html).

    The `plugins` property in the [JSDoc configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html) must include a [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2) plugin reference, as follows:

    ```json
    "plugins": [
        "jsdoc-summarize2"
    ],
    ```

    If needed, you can create a [JSDoc configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html) from scratch in the target project directory (the project you want to document).
    The suggested name is `jsdoc-conf.json`. You can copy the contents from the following example.

    ```json
    {
        "plugins": [
            "jsdoc-summarize2"
        ],
        "recurseDepth": 10,
        "source": {
            "includePattern": ".+\\.js(doc|x)?$",
            "excludePattern": "(^|\\/|\\\\)_"
        },
        "sourceType": "module",
        "tags": {
            "allowUnknownTags": true,
            "dictionaries": [
                "jsdoc",
                "closure"
            ]
        },
        "templates": {
            "cleverLinks": false,
            "monospaceLinks": false
        }
    }
    ```

## How to uninstall

The following instructions [uninstall](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/uninstalling-local-packages) the locally installed packages.
If you did a global rather than a local install, please use `-g` instead of `--save-dev`.

To uninstall [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2):

1. Remove the [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2) plugin reference from the `plugins` property in the [JSDoc configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html).
The installation instructions suggest the name `jsdoc-conf.json` for it.

    ```diff
     "plugins": [
    -    "jsdoc-summarize2"
     ],
    ```

2. Uninstall [Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2).

    ```
    npm uninstall --save-dev jsdoc-summarize2
    ```

If you want to uninstall [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) also:

1. If you changed the `scripts` property in the `package.json` to define a command to execute [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc) via `npm run`, then remove that command definition.

    ```diff
     "scripts": {
    -    "jsdoc": "jsdoc -c jsdoc-conf.json index.js module1.js module2.js"
     },
    ```

2. Delete the [JSDoc configuration file](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html).
The installation instructions suggest the name `jsdoc-conf.json` for it.

    ```
    rm jsdoc-conf.json (Unix)

    del jsdoc-conf.json (Windows)
    ```

3. Uninstall [JSDoc](https://npm.im/jsdoc).

    ```
    npm uninstall --save-dev jsdoc
    ```
