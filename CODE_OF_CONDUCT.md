# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in the
[Summarize2](https://npm.im/jsdoc-summarize2) project.
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.
People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

This code is not exhaustive or complete.
It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment.
We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## The expectations

### Be friendly and patient

Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming
language, and others may not have your level of understanding.

### Be welcoming

Our community welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national
origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex,
sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political
belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

### Be respectful

We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.
Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language.
- Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
- Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

### Understand disagreements

Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities.
Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
